# LiveScriptBrains
A plugin for JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA set if IDE's, primarily targeted for WebStorm.

# Status: v0.0.1f
First version, just barely working. Very basic syntax highlight, comment/uncomment, nothing else. Even syntax highlighting is a work-in-progress. I'm learning as I go.

# Usage
If it's not available from [JetBrains plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7946), download [LiveScriptBrains.jar](LiveScriptBrains.jar) and use the "Install plugin from disc..." option in the IDE to install it.
